        "Coastal flooding is a cause of extreme weather and high tides.  Low-lying seaside areas are in the most danger from coastal flooding.\nRiver flooding is a very common type of inland flooding. It happens when a body of water exceeds the river banks, typically from intense rainfall. This flooding can affect surrounding properties and pose a serious safety threat.\nDrain and Sewer flooding is not always due to extreme weather, though it can be a factor or the cause sometimes. Other times it may be a blockage or failure of the drainage system or an internal problem with the building.\nGroundwater floods take time to transpire. With extended periods of rainfall, the ground becomes waterlogged until it is incapable of absorbing any more. Water then rises above the surface and begins to cause flooding. These floods can last for weeks and even months in some cases.\nFlash floods are a very dangerous form of flooding. Unlike groundwater floods, it happens quickly when the ground cannot absorb water at the speed and amount it’s falling at."
